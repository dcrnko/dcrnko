### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a **Cloud Platform Engineer** with a history in the Linux System Administration. My journey began in the trenches of enterprise-level troubleshooting. 
Currently focused on designing and operating reliable, secure, and maintainable cloud infrastructure.

---

### 🛠️ What I’m up to
I’ve moved from "fixing" systems to "building" them.

* **Infrastructure as Code:** I spend a lot of my time in **Terraform** and **Ansible** turning manual tasks into repeatable code.
* **AWS & Containers:** Building out scalable environments where **containers** actually behave themselves.
* **CI/CD:** Designing pipelines so that code gets where it needs to go without the drama.

- 🔭 **Currently working as:** Cloud Platform Engineer
- 🧠 **Enthusiastic in:** Automating workflows and building cloud infrastructure
- 🎓 **Education:** MSc. Computing
